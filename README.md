# Password Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify passwords as either machine-generated or human-generated using various machine learning models. The project utilizes Python and libraries such as pandas, sklearn, etc.

## Features
The project includes feature engineering from the password strings to create a dataset that includes:
- Length of the password.
- Number of digits in the password.
- Number of letters in the password.
- Number of special characters in the password.

## Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (with k=3 and k=5)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Setup
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system along with the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- sklearn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
